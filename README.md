## Future improvements
- [x] Implement quadtree algorithm to handle big number of objects
- [ ] Optimize simulation performance (maybe involve parallel computation)
- [ ] Add dynamic object creation with mouse interaction
- [ ] Implement collisions
- [ ] Implement optional bodies merge (absorption)
